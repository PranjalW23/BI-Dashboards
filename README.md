# Dashboard Documentation: Global Temperature Analysis

## Dashboard 1: Global Land Temperatures Overview

### Overview
This dashboard provides insights into historical land temperature trends, geographic distributions, and extreme temperature metrics across countries from 1745 to 2013.

### Key Features
1. **Geographic Spread**: Visualizes temperature distribution (possibly "Temperature Spread" instead of "Tef Upgrade").
2. **Temperature Trends Over Years**:
   - Sum of Average Temperature and associated Uncertainty.
   - Time range: 1745–2013.
3. **Extreme Temperature Metrics**:
   - Top 10 Hottest Countries (values in millions: 6M, 4M).
   - Minimum and Maximum Temperatures by Country (19.926°C and 30.991°C).
4. **Country-Level Analysis**:
   - Average Temperature by Country and Year.
   - Temperature Range classification (Cold to Hot).
5. **Global Average**: 17.93°C (aggregate across the dataset).

## Dashboard 2: Global Warming Patterns

### Overview
Focuses on long-term climate trends, seasonal variations, and risks associated with global warming, spanning data from the 1740s to 2010s.

### Key Features
1. **Global Average Temperature Over Time**: Trends across centuries.
2. **Seasonal Analysis**:
   - Averages for Autumn, Spring, Winter, and Summer.
   - Monthly Seasonal Temperature chart (0–10 months, values up to 2.0M).
3. **Temperature vs. Uncertainty**: Comparative metrics (years 1744–1751).
4. **Extreme Cold Analysis**:
   - Top 10 Coldest Countries (Min Avg Temperature: 40°C, possibly a typo).
   - Countries include China, Kazakhstan, the U.S., Canada, and others.
5. **Decadal Trends**: Average Temperature by Decade (1760s–2010s).
6. **Risk Factors**: Listed nations with potential climate risks.

## Data Notes & Assumptions
- **Units**: Temperatures likely in °C; "6M/4M" may represent sums in millions.
- **Possible Typos**:
  - "Tef Upgrade" may refer to "Temperature Spread."
  - "Min Avg Temperature: 40" under Coldest Countries may need verification.
  - "Nations" under Risks is assumed to be "Nations" (intended as "Nations").
- **Time Ranges**: Data spans from the 18th century to 2013, with decadal granularity.

## Usage
- Compare historical temperature trends across countries and seasons.
- Identify high-risk regions for extreme temperatures.
- Analyze long-term global warming patterns and uncertainties.
